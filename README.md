# JayOS

Operating systems class project

Very much a work-in-progress. As of 11/01/24, only two basic processes and a BIOS interface
have been implemented.

As of 11/04/24, this branch is independent of Lesli's for the sake of completing the assignment in a timely manner.
Where my implementation differs is in my decision to make use of C++ for the queue library, rather than creating a homebrewed
solution due to time constraints. Additionally, I have added a Makefile for compilation flags and specifying an include directory
for the header files.
